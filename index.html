        <br>Benjamin Merkli <i>(s3896757)</i><br>  </center>
        <br><b>Background/Hobbies & IT Experience/Interests: </b>
                    <br>I was born here in Melbourne, Australia and
                    <br>grew up in the south-east suburb, Mulgrave, which is located
                    <br>between Springvale and Glen Waverley.
                    <br>I am half Lebanese and half Hungarian; however, I can only
                    <br>speak English fluently based on my upbringing. I attended
                    <br>Glen Waverley South Primary School (2008-2014) and then
                    <br>transitioned to Brentwood Secondary College to complete
                    <br>high school and obtain VCE certificate (2015-2020).
                    <br>
                    <br>I have played Australian Football my entire life, as
                    <br>it is something I really enjoy and quite decent at.
                    <br>One fun fact about me is that I have been invited to a
                    <br>player development course/session with the Oakleigh Chargers
                    <br>and Hawthorn Football clubto improve on my skills and football
                    <br>knowledge, therefore this can become a gateway to the AFL.
                    <br>
                    <br>My interest in IT ranges to a variety of aspects within the
                    <br>term “IT”. I am veryfond of cybersecurity and its ability
                    <br>to protect systems from harmful risks and gain access into
                    <br>areas an average individual would not be able to do.
                    <br>Moreover, I am very interested in the software and hardware
                    <br>that is in a computer and how certain bits and pieces of wires
                    <br>and plastic can create one of the world's most innovative creations.
                    <br>
                    <br>When I was in Year 6 at Glen Waverley South Primary School,
                    <br>I was elected as an ICT captain for the school, which heavily
                    <br>involved being surrounded by computers, interactive whiteboards,
                    <br>and other IT related items. My role was to solve computer related
                    <br>issues students and teachers would endure and solve these issues
                    <br>with the school’s IT department. The role also carried across onto
                    <br>setting up the computers, microphones, and presentation requirements
                    <br>for the school’s weekly assemblies.<br>

                      <br><b>Background/Hobbies</b>
                      <br>I was born and raised in Bendigo which is a country town 2 hours drive from melbourne.
                      My hobbies are mostly just playing video games and going out with mates to pubs and parties and such.
                      <br><br>My interest in IT has mostly been a lifelong thing, my dad works in telecommunications so I was always surrendered by computers, tech, and especially phones, I also realised and expanded this interest in school when I took a number of IT related electives.
                      <br>I have been programming for about 6 years now and I have a fair bit of practical experience with networks and working with phones and the internet because of my dad’s job.


                      <br><b><br>What do these test results mean and how can they be helpful to your group?</b>
                      <br>The results from these tests highlight that I have the personality traits of being a ‘natural-born leader’. People with this personality type embody the gifts of charisma and confidence,
                      sand project authority in a way that draws crowds together behind a common goal. <br><br>After having taken the educationplanner.org Learning Style test with my results coming back as Auditory:
                      35%, Visual: 30%, and Tactile: 35% in terms of learning preferences with resulting <br>learning type being Auditory/Tactile. <br><br>This corresponds to
                      group meetings as I will be able to fully<br> comprehend what each person is saying and understand their <br> deliverance on a deeper level. After having taken the MindTools<br> creativity my results returned
                      as a 56 out of 80, this <br>being in the high part of the middle creativity range of 37-58.

        Joshua Lam <i>(s3902169)</i></center>
        <br><b>Background/Hobbies</b>
        <br>My name is Joshua Lam, and I was born and raised in Australia.
        <br>My ethnicity is half vietnamese and half timorese. I have completed
        VCE Year 12 and graduated with a 72.3 ATAR, which has led me to
        currently study a Bachelors of IT at RMIT. My main spoken language
        is English.
      <br>
        <br>I have loved to play video games ever since I was young,
        <br>and have also recently gained an interest in cars as well. I’ve
        <br>recently purchased a vehicle, a Toyota 86, and have added various
        <br>mods/self-serviced it.
        <br>
        <br>My interest in IT involves enjoying taking
        sthe time to accurately locate and fix problems, and developed since
        I was a young age as I grew up with computers. My IT experience
        revolves mostly around self-learnt abilities such as CMD prompt,
        Device Manager, and being able to make HTML websites. I have also
        bbuilt many computers, including my own and friends.
        <br>
        <br><b>What do these test results mean to you and how can they help your group?</b>
        <br>I find these test results very interesting, as they provide meaningful,
        honest results to reveal what type of personality one has. Being a
        supposed ‘commander’ personality, it depicts that I should show
        leadership within my team, however if there is another ‘commander’
        I am happy to easily follow another <br>person's instructions.
        These personality tests can be used as a basis to
        <br>outline what type of
        learner and person each of your team members <br>are, and further your
        understanding and synergy with them which I<br> believe help to increase
        team productivity.
