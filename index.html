        <br><b>Background/Hobbies & IT Experience/Interests: </b>
                    <br>I was born here in Melbourne, Australia and
                    <br>grew up in the south-east suburb, Mulgrave, which is located
                    <br>between Springvale and Glen Waverley.
                    <br>I am half Lebanese and half Hungarian; however, I can only
                    <br>speak English fluently based on my upbringing. I attended
                    <br>Glen Waverley South Primary School (2008-2014) and then
                    <br>transitioned to Brentwood Secondary College to complete
                    <br>high school and obtain VCE certificate (2015-2020).
                    <br>
                    <br>I have played Australian Football my entire life, as
                    <br>it is something I really enjoy and quite decent at.
                    <br>One fun fact about me is that I have been invited to a
                    <br>player development course/session with the Oakleigh Chargers
                    <br>and Hawthorn Football clubto improve on my skills and football
                    <br>knowledge, therefore this can become a gateway to the AFL.
                    <br>
                    <br>My interest in IT ranges to a variety of aspects within the
                    <br>term “IT”. I am veryfond of cybersecurity and its ability
                    <br>to protect systems from harmful risks, I am also very
                    <br>interested in the software and hardwarethat is in a computer.

                      <br><b>Background/Hobbies & IT Experience/Interests:</b>
                      <br>I was born and raised in Bendigo which is a country town 2 hours drive from melbourne.
                      My hobbies are mostly just playing video games and going out with mates to pubs and parties and such.
                      <br><br>My interest in IT has mostly been a lifelong thing, my dad works in telecommunications so I was always surrendered by computers, tech, and especially phones, I also realised and expanded this interest in school when I took a number of IT related electives.
                      <br>I have been programming for about 6 years now and I have a fair bit of practical experience with networks and working with phones and the internet because of my dad’s job.


                      <br><b><br>What do these test results mean and how can they be helpful to your group?</b>
                      <br>The results from these tests highlight that I have the personality traits of being a ‘natural-born leader’. People with this personality type embody the gifts of charisma and confidence,
                      sand project authority in a way that draws crowds together behind a common goal. <br><br>After having taken the educationplanner.org Learning Style test with my results coming back as Auditory:
                      35%, Visual: 30%, and Tactile: 35% in terms of learning preferences with resulting <br>learning type being Auditory/Tactile. <br><br>This corresponds to
                      group meetings as I will be able to fully<br> comprehend what each person is saying and understand their <br> deliverance on a deeper level. After having taken the MindTools<br> creativity my results returned
                      as a 56 out of 80, this <br>being in the high part of the middle creativity range of 37-58.

      <center>  <b>Personal Information:</b><br>
        Joshua Lam <i>(s3902169)</i></center>
        <br><b>Background/Hobbies & IT Experience/Interests:</b>
        <br>My name is Joshua Lam, and I was born and raised in Australia.
        <br>My ethnicity is half vietnamese and half timorese. I have completed
        VCE Year 12 and graduated with a 72.3 ATAR, which has led me to
        currently study a Bachelors of IT at RMIT. My main spoken language
        is English.
      <br>
        <br>I have loved to play video games ever since I was young,
        <br>and have also recently gained an interest in cars as well. I’ve
        <br>recently purchased a vehicle, a Toyota 86, and have added various
        <br>mods/self-serviced it.
        <br>
        <br>My interest in IT involves enjoying taking
        sthe time to accurately locate and fix problems, and developed since
        I was a young age as I grew up with computers. My IT experience
        revolves mostly around self-learnt abilities such as CMD prompt,
        Device Manager, and being able to make HTML websites. I have also
        bbuilt many computers, including my own and friends.
        <br>
        <br><b>What do these test results mean to you and how can they help your group?</b>
        <br>I find these test results very interesting, as they provide meaningful,
        honest results to reveal what type of personality one has. Being a
        supposed ‘commander’ personality, it depicts that I should show
        leadership within my team, however if there is another ‘commander’
        I am happy to easily follow another <br>person's instructions.
        These personality tests can be used as a basis to
        <br>outline what type of
        learner and person each of your team members <br>are, and further your
        understanding and synergy with them which I<br> believe help to increase
        team productivity.

            Andy Lu <i>(s3902328)</i></center>
            <br><b>Background/Hobbies & IT Experience/Interests:</b>
                <br>My parents both come from Vietnam and they both speak Vietnamese and Cantonese, as do I however I am not very fluent in any of those languages.
                I have just recently graduated high school and I am currently studying my first year of Bachelor of IT at RMIT University. During my spare time,
                I enjoy playing games with my friends. <br><br>Ever since I was young I had always had an interest in IT. It was something that I grew up around.
                My cousins were the ones who inspired and introduced me to computers and IT in general. Where I used to watch my cousins play games on their computers
                 and watch them build and work on their websites. 2017 was the year where my knowledge of IT and computers grew most and was also the year that I decided
                 that I wanted to pursue a career in IT.
                   <br><br>Before starting UNI I had a little bit of experience in HTML from high school where I had taken an Introduction to Computing class, besides that, I didn’t have any experience.
                    However, since I started UNI I recently started to learn Python and as well as learn more HTML.
                Personal Profile
                <br><br><b>What do these test results mean to you and how can they help your group?</b>
                <br>In terms of how these results may reflect in the team, I believe<br> that there are pros and cons, pros being that it may help the team<br> to be more productive if there are individuals who are independent<br> as
                they can take the initiative in completing the set tasks. However, <br>the cons being, individuals who rely mostly on their skills may lack<br> in communicating with their team members which may be <br>counterproductive instead.

      <center><b>Personal Information:</b><br>
      Anton Catalano <i>(s3890351)</i></center>
      <br><b>Background/Hobbies & IT Experience/Interests:</b>
<br>
        Born and raised in Melbourne, Australia.  I have an Italian background, where grandparents from both sides immigrated from Italy.  I completed VCE in 2018. I did study for an undergraduate degree in Speech Pathology at ACU for two years.
        I withdrew at the end of 2020 to pursue something that I am more interested and passionate about, which is IT. Speak fluent English and I’m a passionate follower of sport, especially AFL and EPL. <br><br>My main interest in IT is the fact that I am engaging with technology daily. Whether it's from a television set to a laptop, I utilise it everyday. What's been a constant reminder of gaining interest in IT is of me solving errors that I come across when using a laptop.  Currently, I have great knowledge in knowing how to use a computer. Having utilised a computer for over 10 years now, I can understand the specific basics on how to use it. <br><br>I'm also a keen learner and am willing to add some key skills to my arsenal. Whether it's from my casual job to currently in my first year, I'm really invested in learning new things and gaining such valuable insight.
        <br><br><b>What do these test results mean to you and how can they help your group?</b>
        <br> The results highlighted from the tests indicate that I’m particularly people-focused and am willingly able to provide support to others. It’d be especially helpful from a team based perspective, enabling me to be really engaging when communicating with other people, with a key behaviour of mine being that the more I understand how a person behaves and how they communicate, the more comfortable I become. <br><br> Learning wise, in a group scenario, my tactile style would be particularly helpful when planning out how to undertake a necessary task and noting down all of the team members points of concern. Based on the creativity aspect, it would be vital in my confidence in a group scenario to pitch my ideas or thoughts early on, instead missing out on expressing my thoughts. It's something that I know<br> personally would not only help build that self-confidence but would especially <br>help gain that level of understanding with my team and be able to view from the others perspective.

<section class="interview">
<div class="interviewtext">
<br><br>
        <br>  <b>  What kind of work is done by the IT professional?</b>
  <br>          The current occupation of the IT professional is a Network & Security Engineer. Graduating with a bachelor's degree in Computer science at the age of 22, Alson worked his first IT-related career at the age of 23 as an Analyst Programmer, and moved to Network & Security engineering at the age of 29. Alson’s responsibilities involve a range of tasks, such as;
            -Designing and implementing networks in the OT environment
            -Design and implement virtual infrastructure
            -Provide any type of service that involves networking, servers or cybersecurity
<br><br>
            <b>What kinds of people does the IT professional interact with? Are they other IT professionals? Clients? Investors? The general public?</b>
    <br>        Alson mostly works with customers in the manufacturing industry, but also a large handful of interaction comes from technical managers or engineers when dealing with system design. If there are troubleshoot requests, it is usually with engineers or electricians.
<br><br>
            <b>Where do you spend most of your time in the workplace? At home? In the office? Do you prefer working at home or on-site?</b>
      <br>      At customers' sites, he prefers working on site because it is more convenient to interact with others in the workplace and will always have the necessary tools to perform tasks such as troubleshooting.
            Most of Alson’s interactions with customers is installing a new network or replacing an existing network.
<br><br>
            <b>What aspect of your position is the most challenging?</b>
      <br>      Finding the time to learn new things. In this role, you're expected to keep up with the latest technologies. Not only do you need to keep up with the traditional IT world, but we've gotta keep up with the OT industry too. Finding the time to do training and upskill and any of these new technologies is difficult. Also, when you're constantly in meetings it makes it difficult to actually do any work. But that's really the same for any job.
<br><br>
            <b>What do you find the most appealing about your position? Do you think your position is worth the challenges previously mentioned? Are there any other colleagues/friends that do the same or similar level of work and have they given up/dislike their position?</b>
      <br>      Alson finds the future prospects of his position the most appealing in hopes that it will lead down the path of cybersecurity. Challenges aside, the position has been very interesting and the workplace is very positive. The time spent in this position was a lot more enjoyable than an analyst programmer,  as I get to travel interstate and overseas to perform my tasks, which is a huge plus. One colleague who was in this position recently gave up on this path to head down towards a more sales focused role, due to the challenges being a lot harder than he’d imagined and realised sales fit more for his passion.

          <br>  <b>  [20:04 21/04/2021] Alson Huynh:</b> At customers site and at home
<br>
          <br>  <b>  [20:06 21/04/2021] Joshua Lam:</b> What do you mostly do with customers? Resolve their networking problems? Meetings at home with coworkers?

          <br>  <b>  [20:10 21/04/2021] Alson Huynh:</b> Most of the time it's installing a new network or replacing an existing network
<br>
          <br>  <b>  [20:11, 21/04/2021] Joshua Lam:</b>  What aspect of your position is the most challenging?

          <br>  <b>  [20:18 21/04/2021] Alson Huynh:</b>  Finding the time to learn new things. In this role, you're expected to keep up with the latest technologies. Not only do you need to keep up with the traditional IT world, but we've gotta keep up with the OT industry too. Finding the time to do training and upskill and any of these new technologies is difficult. Also, when you're constantly in meetings it makes it difficult to actually do any work. But that's really the same for any job
<br>
            <br>  <b>[20:23, 21/04/2021] Joshua Lam:</b> What do you find the most appealing about your position? From the scopes, it seems your position is a bit challenging and many others may not have found it worth it. Do you think your position is worth the challenges previously mentioned? Are there any other colleagues/friends that do the same or similar level of work and have they given up/dislike their position?

          <br>  <b>  [20:30, 27/04/2021] Alson Huynh:</b> I find the future prospects of my position the most appealing in hopes that it will lead down the path of cybersecurity. One plus of my job is getting to travel interstate and overseas to perform my tasks, and was definitely a lot more interesting than my analyst programming position. One colleague who was in this position recently gave up on this path to head down towards a more sales focused role, he found the position a bit difficult and enjoyed sales more passionately than network & security engineering.
<br>
          <br>  <b>  [20:35, 27/04/2021] Joshua Lam: </b>Thank you so much for participating in this interview, Alson. Have a wonderful day :).

          <br>  <b>  [20:35, 27/04/2021] Alson Huynh:</b> No worries, any time.

  Blockchain and Cryptocurrencies - Ben
  What does it do? (600 words)
  What is the state of the art of this new technology?
  Blockchain and Cryptocurrencies are two separate terms, however each play a major role with one another. Blockchain is a financial system that allows payments to be instantly delivered from one entity to another, without the need of a third-party interference (e.g., banks). Furthering this statement, Cryptocurrencies can be defined as ‘a form of digital or virtual currencies’ which is carried out by the Blockchain system. Not only does Blockchain allow money transfers directly from one person to another, but it also makes ‘cryptocurrencies immune to counterfeiting’, ‘doesn’t require central authority’ and is ‘protected by strong encryption and algorithms.’
  There are currently more than 4000 listed cryptocurrencies on the market as of January 2021, however, the most noticeable and reliable Crypto’s out there are Bitcoin, Ethereum, Litecoin, Polkadot and a few others. Cryptocurrency is growing and becoming more and more popular within society and is hoping to become a new form of asset alongside commodities, shares, and real currency.
