        <br><b>Background/Hobbies & IT Experience/Interests: </b>
                    <br>I was born here in Melbourne, Australia and
                    <br>grew up in the south-east suburb, Mulgrave, which is located
                    <br>between Springvale and Glen Waverley.
                    <br>I am half Lebanese and half Hungarian; however, I can only
                    <br>speak English fluently based on my upbringing. I attended
                    <br>Glen Waverley South Primary School (2008-2014) and then
                    <br>transitioned to Brentwood Secondary College to complete
                    <br>high school and obtain VCE certificate (2015-2020).
                    <br>
                    <br>I have played Australian Football my entire life, as
                    <br>it is something I really enjoy and quite decent at.
                    <br>One fun fact about me is that I have been invited to a
                    <br>player development course/session with the Oakleigh Chargers
                    <br>and Hawthorn Football clubto improve on my skills and football
                    <br>knowledge, therefore this can become a gateway to the AFL.
                    <br>
                    <br>My interest in IT ranges to a variety of aspects within the
                    <br>term “IT”. I am veryfond of cybersecurity and its ability
                    <br>to protect systems from harmful risks, I am also very
                    <br>interested in the software and hardwarethat is in a computer.

                      <br><b>Background/Hobbies & IT Experience/Interests:</b>
                      <br>I was born and raised in Bendigo which is a country town 2 hours drive from melbourne.
                      My hobbies are mostly just playing video games and going out with mates to pubs and parties and such.
                      <br><br>My interest in IT has mostly been a lifelong thing, my dad works in telecommunications so I was always surrendered by computers, tech, and especially phones, I also realised and expanded this interest in school when I took a number of IT related electives.
                      <br>I have been programming for about 6 years now and I have a fair bit of practical experience with networks and working with phones and the internet because of my dad’s job.


                      <br><b><br>What do these test results mean and how can they be helpful to your group?</b>
                      <br>The results from these tests highlight that I have the personality traits of being a ‘natural-born leader’. People with this personality type embody the gifts of charisma and confidence,
                      sand project authority in a way that draws crowds together behind a common goal. <br><br>After having taken the educationplanner.org Learning Style test with my results coming back as Auditory:
                      35%, Visual: 30%, and Tactile: 35% in terms of learning preferences with resulting <br>learning type being Auditory/Tactile. <br><br>This corresponds to
                      group meetings as I will be able to fully<br> comprehend what each person is saying and understand their <br> deliverance on a deeper level. After having taken the MindTools<br> creativity my results returned
                      as a 56 out of 80, this <br>being in the high part of the middle creativity range of 37-58.

        Joshua Lam <i>(s3902169)</i></center>
        <br><b>Background/Hobbies & IT Experience/Interests:</b>
        <br>My name is Joshua Lam, and I was born and raised in Australia.
        <br>My ethnicity is half vietnamese and half timorese. I have completed
        VCE Year 12 and graduated with a 72.3 ATAR, which has led me to
        currently study a Bachelors of IT at RMIT. My main spoken language
        is English.
      <br>
        <br>I have loved to play video games ever since I was young,
        <br>and have also recently gained an interest in cars as well. I’ve
        <br>recently purchased a vehicle, a Toyota 86, and have added various
        <br>mods/self-serviced it.
        <br>
        <br>My interest in IT involves enjoying taking
        sthe time to accurately locate and fix problems, and developed since
        I was a young age as I grew up with computers. My IT experience
        revolves mostly around self-learnt abilities such as CMD prompt,
        Device Manager, and being able to make HTML websites. I have also
        bbuilt many computers, including my own and friends.
        <br>
        <br><b>What do these test results mean to you and how can they help your group?</b>
        <br>I find these test results very interesting, as they provide meaningful,
        honest results to reveal what type of personality one has. Being a
        supposed ‘commander’ personality, it depicts that I should show
        leadership within my team, however if there is another ‘commander’
        I am happy to easily follow another <br>person's instructions.
        These personality tests can be used as a basis to
        <br>outline what type of
        learner and person each of your team members <br>are, and further your
        understanding and synergy with them which I<br> believe help to increase
        team productivity.

            Andy Lu <i>(s3902328)</i></center>
            <br><b>Background/Hobbies & IT Experience/Interests:</b>
                <br>My parents both come from Vietnam and they both speak Vietnamese and Cantonese, as do I however I am not very fluent in any of those languages.
                I have just recently graduated high school and I am currently studying my first year of Bachelor of IT at RMIT University. During my spare time,
                I enjoy playing games with my friends. <br><br>Ever since I was young I had always had an interest in IT. It was something that I grew up around.
                My cousins were the ones who inspired and introduced me to computers and IT in general. Where I used to watch my cousins play games on their computers
                 and watch them build and work on their websites. 2017 was the year where my knowledge of IT and computers grew most and was also the year that I decided
                 that I wanted to pursue a career in IT.
                   <br><br>Before starting UNI I had a little bit of experience in HTML from high school where I had taken an Introduction to Computing class, besides that, I didn’t have any experience.
                    However, since I started UNI I recently started to learn Python and as well as learn more HTML.
                Personal Profile
                <br><br><b>What do these test results mean to you and how can they help your group?</b>
                <br>In terms of how these results may reflect in the team, I believe<br> that there are pros and cons, pros being that it may help the team<br> to be more productive if there are individuals who are independent<br> as
                they can take the initiative in completing the set tasks. However, <br>the cons being, individuals who rely mostly on their skills may lack<br> in communicating with their team members which may be <br>counterproductive instead.

      <center><b>Personal Information:</b><br>
      Anton Catalano <i>(s3890351)</i></center>
      <br><b>Background/Hobbies & IT Experience/Interests:</b>
<br>
        Born and raised in Melbourne, Australia.  I have an Italian background, where grandparents from both sides immigrated from Italy.  I completed VCE in 2018. I did study for an undergraduate degree in Speech Pathology at ACU for two years.
        I withdrew at the end of 2020 to pursue something that I am more interested and passionate about, which is IT. Speak fluent English and I’m a passionate follower of sport, especially AFL and EPL. <br><br>My main interest in IT is the fact that I am engaging with technology daily. Whether it's from a television set to a laptop, I utilise it everyday. What's been a constant reminder of gaining interest in IT is of me solving errors that I come across when using a laptop.  Currently, I have great knowledge in knowing how to use a computer. Having utilised a computer for over 10 years now, I can understand the specific basics on how to use it. <br><br>I'm also a keen learner and am willing to add some key skills to my arsenal. Whether it's from my casual job to currently in my first year, I'm really invested in learning new things and gaining such valuable insight.
        <br><br><b>What do these test results mean to you and how can they help your group?</b>
        <br> The results highlighted from the tests indicate that I’m particularly people-focused and am willingly able to provide support to others. It’d be especially helpful from a team based perspective, enabling me to be really engaging when communicating with other people, with a key behaviour of mine being that the more I understand how a person behaves and how they communicate, the more comfortable I become. <br><br> Learning wise, in a group scenario, my tactile style would be particularly helpful when planning out how to undertake a necessary task and noting down all of the team members points of concern. Based on the creativity aspect, it would be vital in my confidence in a group scenario to pitch my ideas or thoughts early on, instead missing out on expressing my thoughts. It's something that I know<br> personally would not only help build that self-confidence but would especially <br>help gain that level of understanding with my team and be able to view from the others perspective.

            <br>                     <b> Interviewee:</b> Alson Huynh</center>

<section class="interview">
<div class="interviewtext">

        <br>  <b>  What kind of work is done by the IT professional?</b>
  <br>          The current occupation of the IT professional is a Network & Security Engineer. Graduating with a bachelor's degree in Computer science at the age of 22, Alson worked his first IT-related career at the age of 23 as an Analyst Programmer, and moved to Network & Security engineering at the age of 29. Alson’s responsibilities involve a range of tasks, such as;
            -Designing and implementing networks in the OT environment
            -Design and implement virtual infrastructure
            -Provide any type of service that involves networking, servers or cybersecurity
<br><br>
            <b>What kinds of people does the IT professional interact with? Are they other IT professionals? Clients? Investors? The general public?</b>
    <br>        Alson mostly works with customers in the manufacturing industry, but also a large handful of interaction comes from technical managers or engineers when dealing with system design. If there are troubleshoot requests, it is usually with engineers or electricians.
<br><br>
            <b>Where do you spend most of your time in the workplace? At home? In the office? Do you prefer working at home or on-site?</b>
      <br>      At customers' sites, he prefers working on site because it is more convenient to interact with others in the workplace and will always have the necessary tools to perform tasks such as troubleshooting.
            Most of Alson’s interactions with customers is installing a new network or replacing an existing network.
<br><br>
            <b>What aspect of your position is the most challenging?</b>
      <br>      Finding the time to learn new things. In this role, you're expected to keep up with the latest technologies. Not only do you need to keep up with the traditional IT world, but we've gotta keep up with the OT industry too. Finding the time to do training and upskill and any of these new technologies is difficult. Also, when you're constantly in meetings it makes it difficult to actually do any work. But that's really the same for any job.
<br><br>
            <b>What do you find the most appealing about your position? Do you think your position is worth the challenges previously mentioned? Are there any other colleagues/friends that do the same or similar level of work and have they given up/dislike their position?</b>
      <br>      Alson finds the future prospects of his position the most appealing in hopes that it will lead down the path of cybersecurity. Challenges aside, the position has been very interesting and the workplace is very positive. The time spent in this position was a lot more enjoyable than an analyst programmer,  as I get to travel interstate and overseas to perform my tasks, which is a huge plus. One colleague who was in this position recently gave up on this path to head down towards a more sales focused role, due to the challenges being a lot harder than he’d imagined and realised sales fit more for his passion.

    Blockchain and Cryptocurrencies

    <section class="Cryptocurrency and Blockchain">
        <h2>What does it do? (600 words)</h2>

        <h3>What is the state of the art of this new technology?</h3>
        Blockchain and Cryptocurrencies are two separate terms, however each play a major role with one another. Blockchain is a financial system that allows payments to be instantly delivered from one entity to another, without the need of a third-party interference (e.g., banks). Furthering this statement, Cryptocurrencies can be defined as ‘a form of digital or virtual currencies’ which is carried out by the Blockchain system. Not only does Blockchain allow money transfers directly from one person to another, but it also makes ‘cryptocurrencies immune to counterfeiting’, ‘doesn’t require central authority’ and is ‘protected by strong encryption and algorithms.’

        <br><br>There are currently more than 4000 listed cryptocurrencies on the market as of January 2021, however, the most noticeable and reliable Crypto’s out there are Bitcoin, Ethereum, Litecoin, Polkadot and a few others. Cryptocurrency is growing and becoming more and more popular within society and is hoping to become a new form of asset alongside commodities, shares, and real currency.

        <br>
        <img class="crypto1png" src="css/crypto1.jpg">
<div class="cryptotxt1">
        <h3>What can be done now? </h3>
          Blockchain and Cryptocurrencies are becoming popular and are slowly being used as another form of payment for a good or service within the market. In recent times, electric car company, Tesla, have now allowed their vehicles to be purchased via Bitcoin.

          <br><br>Nowadays, with the introduction of Cryptocurrency exchanges and wallets, people all over the world can now purchase their choice of Cryptocurrency through an exchange and either spend it or save it just like real money. Moreover, with the continuous changes and fluctuations in prices within the Blockchain and Cryptocurrency market, people tend to save their Crypto assets in a wallet (hot wallet or cold wallet) in the hope to gain a profit on their investments. There are currently two ways people store their Cryptocurrency and it is done via a cold wallet or a hot wallet. A hot wallet is practically an “online/digital wallet” which gives an individual a secure link to store and send their Crypto money from. Whereas a cold wallet is a digital wallet that can be physically touched and held by a person which has the same processes as a hot wallet. Cold wallets are the safest method to store Cryptocurrency as it has no direct link to the web and cannot be hacked.

          <br><br>Blockchain and Cryptocurrency is socially known as the currency of the dark web, which is true, however misconceptions of Cryptocurrency have caused an uneased influence throughout society. Blockchain and Crypto is heavily used to purchase and exchange illegal goods and services via the dark web, thereby the misapprehension evolved, and this form of currency has often been negatively viewed from time to time. However, with the continuous stories of people becoming wealthy off Cryptocurrency and everyday businesses using Crypto as a form of payment, this has led to Blockchain and Crypto becoming a global phenomenon.

          <h3>What is likely to be done soon (say in the next 3 years)?</h3>
          With Blockchain and Cryptocurrency, it is difficult to say what it is going to be like in the next 3 years. With the development of new Crypto’s or better known as tokens, this will generate large competition within the Blockchain market, allowing the rise and fall of ‘tokens’ to commence.
          <br><br>As well-known businesses are incorporating Bitcoin as a form of payment, such as Tesla, this will influence companies on a global scale to accept Cryptocurrency as a form of payment and it will become the new financial ‘norm’ to nations, especially first world countries.
          <br><br>Banks all around the globe may go under from this due to a shift in societal trends and habits, causing big name banks to suffer and possibly, become non-existent.

          <h3><b>What technological or other developments make this possible?</b><br></h3>
          There are many technological developments that allow Blockchain and Cryptocurrency to flow and function as a currency. The process of selling and purchasing a good or service in a transaction other than normal currency, is what maintains the strong reputation Crypto holds. Furthering this statement, as more tokens are developed, more people purchasing Crypto and more sales being processed, this balances out the market cap of Cryptocurrency and enables businesses to accept another form of income, at times avoiding declaration.

  <div class="cryptotxt2">
          <h2>What is the likely impact? (300 words)</h2>

          <h3>What is the potential impact of this development?</h3>
          <p>There are many potential impacts that Blockchain and Cryptocurrency can provide as its main aim is to change the way we financially interact with one another. This new development allows people with a smartphone who do not have access to financial services, have greater access to the global economy, making this ideal for third world countries.
          <p>Blockchain and Cryptocurrency is designed specifically for not having the need for a centralised party or ‘middle-man’ during the process of a transaction. Therefore, payments become instant, transactions are untracked, and transaction fees become abolished.
          <h3>What is likely to change? Which people will be most affected and how?</h3>
          <p>There are many changes that can occur due to the takeover of Blockchain and Cryptocurrency, specifically a rise in the standard of living for third world countries. As third world countries nowadays have greater access to technology and limitations to financial services, the transactions for goods and services will most likely shift to Crypto, improving the global economy and trade between countries. International relations may improve and become stronger with a new global currency in place, improving standard of living, health and economies in a large majority of countries.

<div class="cryptotxt3">          <h3>Will this create, replace or make redundant any current jobs or technologies?</h3>
          The whole world will be affected by this change, and it already is. By changing the way, we send and receive money, this will heavily impact banks on a global scale. As there are no transaction fees, the profits banks are used to making, will result in a major job loss for those working in banks as the world is becoming more technological.
          Additionally, there is a very high possibility of new jobs opening as businesses may seek individuals to help change the business structure, allowing an inflation of jobs in the financial sector to help balance out the Blockchain/Cryptocurrency market.
          <i>(Coinbase, 2018)</i>

          <h2>How will this affect you? (300 words)</h2>
            <br>In your daily life, how will this affect you?
    <br>        -        Now, Blockchain and Cryptocurrency not affecting me, however the way I earn my income could potentially change sooner than I thought. As I have current crypto investments in my portfolio, there is a possibility that it may generate a solid financial return for me in the future.
        <br>    -        As Blockchain and Cryptocurrency won’t dramatically change my daily life, it will however cause a shift from normal banking to Cryptocurrency which will most likely take quite some time to get used to.
        <br>  <br>  What will be different for you?
          <br>  -         I will become more in control of my income and savings when Blockchain and Cryptocurrency becomes more noticeable globally.
          <br>  -         The opportunity for more jobs may arise, both nationally and internationally. Therefore, changes in my career are bound to happen surrounding the strive for income and aspirations for career development.
          <br>  -         Personal attitude towards security and technology will change, I will become much more aware and stricter with the process of my income, savings and payments.
        <br>  <br>  How might this affect members of your family and friends?
          <br>  -         Older family members will most likely stick to the current currency as that is what they are most used to. The need for keeping up with current trends won’t necessarily apply to these individuals in my life as they are close to reaching their retirement stage.
          <br>  -         Friends of mine will obviously have to shift from current currency to Blockchain and Crypto to keep up with the current trends, resulting in changing relations and communications with certain people. </pre>

                  <h2>What does it do? (600 words)</h2>
              <h3>What is the state of the art of this new technology?</h3>
                <p>     <b>Cyber security </b> refers to the defense of computers, servers, mobile phones, networks and other electronic devices or systems within an organisation or an individuals life, protecting theses devices/services from malicious attacks such as viruses, worms and trojans. As of the 2021 the current state of Cyber security has been lacking which can be seen by various database leaks that have occurred recently examples include the Facebook Database leak on the 3rd of April 2021 which exposed over 533 million accounts along with the users phone numbers and personal information. Another example of this is the recent Ubiquiti Inc. database breach on the 11th of January 2021 where Ubiquiti’s servers were accessed through a third party cloud provider where hackers asked for 50BTC (equivalent to 3.4Million AUD) in exchange for their servers back. As seen from the examples the current state of cybersecurity is flawed in many ways. As of now there have been many models used in the development of Cybersecurity some of which include Software-Defined Security (SDS).
                    <br><br>    <b>Software-Defined Security(SDS) </b> p is an architectural model in cybersecurity that enables the protection and compliance of systems, dissociating the influence of physical topology which is related to the arrangement of a computer networks, and the mapping of specific elements within a computers network, such as the placement of cables and location of devices. This model is extremely pivotal within Cybersecurity as it allows for security and compliance to operate harmoniously with Software-Defined infrastructure models that also separate application and data hosting from the hardware. Furthermore Software-Defined Security comprise of many principles such as Automation, Orchestration and Automatic scalability.

              <br><br>
                        The <b>Automation </b> p principle primarily revolves around the minimisation of human intervention in the development, configuration, ongoing operations as well as deprovisioning in order to maximise compliance and security capabilities. Furthermore, automation is pivotal to the security of a system allowing for firewall policies, vulnerability scans, intrusion detections to be enforced without the need for human intervention. Additionally, allowing for effective and efficient operation in terms of the initial distribution of these security measures as well as the ongoing maintenance and monitoring of systems. The implementation of automation will provide cybersecurity organizations with the ability to compete with the rate of change associated with new upcoming infrastructure models further improving the security effectiveness.
              <br><br>

                        The <b>Software-Defined </b> principle of orchestration defines the association between data classification and the security policies and services an example being the hosting models whether it is private or public, application nationality whether serving US or EU citizens. In addition to this, the orchestration principle is a process that integrates system processes and  diverse ecosystems of Security Operation Center (SOCS) tools which aid in monitor, detect, and respond to threats to a system to allow for automation, leading to more effect and efficient security operations, where a system which is not unified will result to increased security risks and greater inefficiencies.
              <br><br>

                        The principle of <b>Automatic scalability </b> p expresses that security and compliance must be able to be scaled down and up without the need of human intervention. Security and compliance controls must be automatically scalable in order to compete with elastic compt models which is one of the concepts in cloud computing that enable resources to be scaled up and down easily by the cloud service provider. Furthermore, Automatic scalability allows a network, organisation or a software to grow and adapt to the influx of demand, however, Automatic scalability is a principle which is achieved through the principles of Automation and Orchestration. </pre>

              <h3>What can be done now? </h3>
                    The Future of Cyber Security is closely linked with the future of technology in the world and the computer systems that need to be protected. However, in terms of what can be done now to advance Cyber Security as a whole that is the advancement of <b>Artificial Intelligence (AI)</b>, which is a branch of computer science that aims to simulate and replicate the capabilities of the human mind through analysing and learning through experience, recognising objects, responding and understanding languages as well as making decisions.
                    <br><br>
                        In relation to the types of AI they consist of three different types, <b>Artificial Narrow Intelligence (ANI)</b> which is AI that exhibits a narrow range of abilities, <b>Artificial general Intelligence (AGI)</b> which is AI with the same capabilities as a human and lastly, <b>Artificial superintelligence (ASI)</b> AI that suprasses human capabilities. ANI was created in 1956 where AGI and ASI have yet to be created. As of now there are many improvements that can be made to ANI in particular is creating a new AI algorithm or even improving on a current AI algorithm.
                        <br><br>
                        AI algorithms are a process of rules given to the AI software that will enable the AI to update and learn from previous outcomes without the need of human intervention, allowing the AI to improve on its own. By creating and improving on Deep Learning (DL) algorithms which is the most advanced subset of AI  which will allow the  AI software to make decisions based on past patterns but also making changes on its own. Which in turn, will improve Cybersecurity as a whole, evolving threat protection by detecting more advanced threats by learning from past threats and attack patterns it will allow the DL algorithm to recognise suspicious activities that can potentially indicate the presence of threats.
                      <h3>What is likely to be done soon (say in the next 3 years)? </h3>
                        Within the next three years <b>Artificial Intelligence (AI)</b> may potentially be a pivotal component of all cybersecurity systems in the future, which will be a extremely beneficial improvement where the implementation of AI in cybersecurity systems will allow for the elimination of human error in the setup of systems which is a significant weakness of cybersecurity systems, with the implementation of AI it will help identify as well as mitigate issues that appear through the replacement, modification and update of network systems.
                        <br><br>
                        Furthermore, with AI potentially being implemented as a core component of cybersecurity systems this will also significantly improve threat response time which is one of the most vital metrics for a cybersecurity system.
              <br><br>
                        Human responses can differ from person to person even with common threats which commonly prevents the successful prevention of attempted malicious attacks. With AI being integrated within cyber security systems  it will provide users with simplified reports as well as recommended actions that will assist in limiting and preventing future threats from damaging existing systems. On the other hand, the integration of AI in Cybersecurity will also lead to potentially greater threats, an example being hackers targeting AI systems in order to discover vulnerabilities in the AI which will also provide hackers with a means to counteract the AI system.


                      <h3>What technological or other developments make this possible?</h3>
                        What makes the developments in Cybersecurity possible are mainly the large interest Cybersecurity has drawn as well as the increased spending growths by companies in the Cybersecurity department which is evident through research reports published by ‘ESG’ that displayed that 62% of organisations that were surveyed said they would increase their spending budgets and with 32% saying that they would leave their cybersecurity budgets flat.
              <br><br>
                        Furthermore, statistics from Gartner indicate an increased spending growth on IT departments in organisations globally from 2020 increasing by 3.7% increasing the budget to 3,872 billion from 3,732 billion, and further increasing by 3.8% in 2021 which pushed the budget towards 4,018 billion. With the increasing spending limits alones this will aid tremendously in future developments for Cybersecurity. Leading to improved threat detection and response focused on network monitoring which will allow cybersecurity systems to detect and respond to new threats. As well as the potential possibility of complete integration of AI into cybersecurity systems.

                      <h3>  What is the potential impact of this development?</h3>
                      <p>  The impact of increased spending growths on cybersecurity as a whole is extremely significant as well as extremely impactful, expediting and evolving the current cybersecurity systems around the world. With increased spending budgets this can potentially impact cybersecurity systems in ways such as improved regulatory compliance referring to the protection of integrity, confidentiality and accessibility of information stored, reduced incidents and system breaches which will detect and prevent possible hackers from accessing sensitive information, the ability for cybersecurity systems to identify new and evolving threats which will be pivotal in protecting systems, and finally improved ability in cybersecurity systems to respond and investigate events and incidents without the need of human intervention.

                      <h3>What is likely to change? Which people will be most affected and how?</h3>
                    <p>    The impact of increased spending budgets will impact society dramatically especially organisations specialising in the Cybersecurity department where the increased spending budget we can expect to see greater technological developments such as the complete integration of AI in Cybersecurity systems. This will not only affect organisations but individuals, individuals who rely on the cybersecurity systems and expect their information to be protected and secure.
                      <br><br>With the increased spending budgets new advancements in cybersecurity will arise to ensure the maximum protection of users from potential threats, an example of this is Deep Learning (DL) which analyses a systems past encounters with threats using this information to make decisions that will aid in detecting the threat, preventing the threat from damaging the system in the future. Additionally, with the advancement of cybersecurity systems come with more advanced threats where we will start to see evolved threats that will try and counteract and expose vulnerabilities of the cybersecurity systems.

                      <h3>Will this create, replace or make redundant any current jobs or technologies?</h3>
                    <p>   With advancements in Cybersecurity the possibly of redundancy in particular jobs is plausible as well as the possibility to replace some jobs, IT jobs that require employees to identify issues and problems with a system may not exist if Artificial Intelligence (AI)  is completely integrated into cybersecurity, as it will no longer require humans to identify threats and problems as everything will be completed by AI in a much more accurate and quick manner. Furthermore, if increased spending growth led to the integration of AI, humans could possibly be replaced which will lead to many benefits such as the elimination of human error, and human problems such as stress and boredom. On the other hand, some jobs won’t be replaced or made redundant, jobs that require monitoring an AI system won't be replaced, and  jobs in the cybersecurity field that require creative thinking also cannot be replaced not right now at least with the current technology of AI.

                      <h3>In your daily life, how will this affect you? </h3>
                       The growth and development of cybersecurity won’t have such a large impact upon me and my life, however the ways in which the growth of cybersecurity would affect me is my online profile on applications with large user platforms such as Facebook and Snapchat where my privacy and information is dependant on the the level of the cybersecurity systems these organisations provide especially that of Facebook where their database was breached earlier this year due to three bugs used in combination to break into Facebook's database. Furthermore, the development of cybersecurity will have limited impact on my daily life as compared to others such as those with occupations in cybersecurity where their job may be at risk of being replaced by automation.

                      <h3> 	What will be different for you? </h3>
                       There won’t be too many things that will be different to us, as students the development of cybersecurity has little to no impact as of now however this may change in the future once we graduate and start looking for work within the cybersecurity field the available of these positions may be limited due how much cybersecurity as evolved as a whole, where jobs that are available now are no longer available as they now have been replaced by AI.

                      <h3> How might this affect members of your family or your friends? </h3>
                        As cybersecurity develops the privacy and information of users will become even more secure, this will impact both my friends in family mentally and emotionally rather than physically by making them feel relieved and happy that they are able to rely on the safety provided by cybersecurity systems globally. Additionally, security or cybersecurity systems will not only ensure the privacy of my family and friends are protected but also the information and privacy of everyone else's in the world.

          Autonomous Vehicles
        </div>
        <br><br>
          <h2>What does it do? (600 words)</h2>
          <h3>What is the state of the art of this new technology?</h3>
          <p>Autonomous vehicles are engineered-based vehicles, designed to be capable of sensing the environment and operating a vehicle, a car, without the required input of a human. Its commonly known as the future of driving, linked with possibly helping minimise the risk of on road vehicle accidents alongside with road congestion.

          There are so many factors that revolve around configuring an autonomous vehicle, with many intricate components relying on one another. For the software to be incorporated and properly executed, autonomous vehicles would particularly rely on things like sensors, actuators, complex algorithms and machine learning just to name a few. Sensors situated around various parts of the vehicle are assigned with a variety of different roles.

          <p>For example, radar sensors, that are situated towards the front of the vehicle detects the surroundings of neighbouring vehicles, whilst light detection and ranging sensors, situated at the roof of the vehicles, measures the appropriate distancing between vehicles and identifies lane markings.

          These sensors would then be processed through the installed software, which would eventually control the overall vehicles acceleration, braking and steering. Other additional incorporated features in the vehicle would importantly help follow the traffic rules, especially speed limit and navigate obstacles, such as roadworks or unnecessary objects on road.

          <h3>What can be done now?</h3>
          <p>Currently, the National Transport Commission is running a nationwide program called the Automated Vehicle program whereby the programs prerogative reforms on achieving national consistency for autonomous vehicles. That specifically means, supporting the safe commercial deployment of these vehicles and them being operational at all levels of automation all across Australia.
          As it stands in modern society, current laws don’t essentially support the use of these “driverless cars” on public roads. With the ever rising promise of the benefits of this technology, these nationwide reforms can help build the support, safety, and trust of road users, once these vehicles are on our roads.
          <p>Also, in terms of the control of automated vehicles, there is a current guideline supported by the SAE International Association, that defines the 6 levels of driving automation. They range from level 0, meaning your driving and are constantly supervising the vehicle via accelerating, braking and steering to level 5, which coincides with full automated driving conditions and no required need to take over driving.
          <br><br>As iterated in the image below, when the level of driving automation is between 3 and 5, it would mean that the automated system monitors the driving environment, ranging from conditionally to fully automated.

<div class"autotxt1">
  <br><br><br>
        <h3>	What is likely to be done soon (say in the next 3 years)? </h3>
        <p>According to the National Roads and Motorists’ Association (NRMA), fully operational autonomous vehicles could be present on Australian roads, through as early as 2025. What’s particularly fascinating is the fact that it is projected that as of early as 2025, these cars wouldn’t even have a steering wheel nor accelerator present, and it wouldn’t at all require human assistance.
        <p>Most of the well-known car manufacturers, including Toyota, Volkswagen and Mercedes are involved in this evolution of car manufacturing, through developing cars of this calibre. Currently as it stands, most of these brands are at that level 4 category in the SAE International levels of driving automation. In particular, they’re focusing on incorporating the feature of not requiring human assistance whilst driving, with support features like steering wheel/accelerator may not be present.
        Even non car brands including Bosch and Intel are wanting action in this historic evolution in developing the software capable of functioning these vehicles and are hoping to be one of those early manufacturers to release their fully autonomous vehicles on roads in 2025.
        <h3>What technological or other developments make this possible?</h3>
        <p>All vehicle manufactures that are part of this are coinciding on making technological developments that would best enhance the car and make all this possible. These car manufacturers themselves, would need to work particularly close with those providers which specialise in hardware, software and research.
        Most notably, NVIDIA is heavily involved in the process of developing the software equipped for operating a driverless vehicle, and there are several operating systems equipped in the vehicle that controls many components of the car. <p>For instance, an integrated system monitoring the occupants inside the vehicle, is designed basically to observe and ensure the safety of the occupants inside the car.
        It can track a driver’s perception and view whether they’re paying attention or not and can also measure a driver’s fatigue and drowsiness when behind the wheel. Furthermore, there can be other integrated software that provides real-times self-driving applications like controlling a vehicle's motion, like navigation and lane changing is what is integrated and designed to achieve.
        <h2>What is the likely impact? (300 words)</h2>
        <h3>What is the potential impact of this development? </h3>
        <p>Saying the impacts of these developments to be significant, would be quite the understatement. The introduction of autonomous vehicles would provide vital support for many industries in Australia. Technology of this calibre can help create opportunities for energy providers, as it not only reduces the demand for numerous types of energy, but it can also cause them to reconsider how to use alternate energy.
        Autonomous vehicles can also reshape how the financial insurance scheme operates, and from a healthcare perspective, improve emergency services response times. They can also minimise city and traffic congestion, giving government and transportation services vital information upon how they can improve on their respective sectors.
        <h3>What is likely to change? </h3>
        <p>Which people will be most affected and how? Many things would change with the introduction of autonomous vehicles onto our roads. Road usage, the most notable of changes would see space between cars reduced and reaction times of these vehicles being quite instantaneous unlike the normal reaction time of human being seconds.
        The common conception which the general Australian population, especially the elderly, would be the lack of acceptance in terms of having familiarity with the vehicles of high automation. Lack of understanding in terms of how the technology operates and level it is, coinciding with how safe the vehicles are and beneficial, very much iterates how this does affect and what higher officials can do to restore confidence of how significant these developments are for the future.

<div class="autotxt2">
        <h3>Will this create, replace or make redundant any current jobs or technologies?</h3>
        <p>The introduction of autonomous vehicles will have a significant impact on employment for human drivers but would provide opportunities for jobs in sectors such as manufacturing and agriculture. From the CEDA (Committee for Economic Development of Australia), it is projected that within the next decade, nearly 5 million jobs categorised as technological, socioeconomic and demographic drivers, face the likelihood of being replaced.
        Meanwhile, the introduction of autonomous vehicles into society will increasingly present new jobs, into some already present sectors of the following: Manufacturing, mining, agriculture and integration with global value chains. It will also increase demand in these sectors, alongside revolutionising already established business models and creating new industries.
        <p>Roles in this production could include maintenance and operation of the vehicles, whilst working with automated vehicles to incorporate services to the market can also be projected as a prospective job.
        In preparation for the inevitable effect it would present in terms of employment, it would be vital to understand that mitigating through this would pose a great challenge for the unemployed.
        <p>While there is prospective hope that this will provide new jobs in a range of sectors, it will be vital for higher officials in government and industries to brace and plan for the disruption that introducing autonomous vehicles will bring to the employment environment.
        <h2>  How will this affect you? (300 words) </h2>
	<h3>In your daily life, how will this affect you?</h3>
        <p> Autonomous vehicles and its introduction personally would be especially fascinating but also I’d feel inclined to have my concerns every time I’m in this vehicle. It would prove to be quite beneficial and handy for many contextual encounters in life, whether it for instance being tired or having alcohol in my system. It provides that convenience from not only a social perspective, but it’d also be something bar any mishaps or issues, be reliable in getting me from point a to point b.
        There’s always a caution of safety no matter when getting behind the wheel and through personal experience, more likely than not, accidents eventuate because of human error. So when utilising an autonomous vehicle, hearing how there's a greater improved safety when using this vehicle and lowered chance of there being an accident, it provides a little comfort in knowing how reliable it can be.
        <h3>What will be different for you?</h3>
         <p>It would obviously be different drastically as my life would be in the hands of technology, basically. Instinct of mine would be to when in the driver’s seat, would be to utilise the driver controls straight away and with these vehicles not incorporating a steering wheel or visible accelerator/brake, in a level 3-5 autonomous vehicle would be concerning yet something I’d become accustomed to through familiarity.
        <h3>How might this affect members of your family or your friends?</h3>
        <p>Perhaps the trust aspect of vehicle controlling every solitary aspect would be a point of concern for members of my family and friends. Having that familiarity of how it operates and developing that confidence in the vehicle's ability to do what a human does, without any assistance would come in due time.
        Additionally, heavy reassurance through media campaigns and expert support would really help reassure my family and friends for not only the safety it provides but its reliability in transportation and convenience in any contextual scenario.

<section class="projectidea">
          <div class="txt1">
          <h2>Overview</h2>
          My project idea consists of a new, innovative way people in Australia can communicate sport related topics/discussions, with the use of other tools to help them gamble responsibly and have a higher chance of obtaining profit. I would like to create “SportsBuzz”, a website/app that is easily accessible to the public which will allow sport-minded individuals to open to an app that will show live odds from competing sport betting platforms (e.g., SportsBet, Bet365, etc) and compare the prices, giving users a quick insight on what every platform has to offer and what the recommended bet they should place on any match.
          Furthermore, I would like this project to contain a live thread discussion, which enables all users to give their opinion on what the odds and expectations are for any game from any sport.
          <h3>Motivation</h3>
          <br>As sports betting has grown to become a national issue over the past decade, more and more Australians are continuing to lose their hard-earned cash over these addictive gambling platforms. Close friends and family of mine love to gamble, yet they lose quite a fair amount of money each time a bet is placed. Additionally, the Federal Government has not provided any regulations on these platforms, therefore making it hard for punters to quit or even limit their expenditure. From this, I have noticed that there are not many accessible tools online to help individuals make an informed decision when placing a bet. Although there are reddit pages and websites highlighting plausible bet outcomes, these online tools can become quite confusing and overwhelming for the user, thereby an irrational bet is placed, and money is lost. As I do not fully support the act of ‘gambling’, I have noticed there aren’t many services out there that will help people place a bet smartly and safely, thus the introduction of “SportsBuzz” can assist with this issue.

    <br>  <li>          Live odds of competing sport betting platforms. Indicating which platform offers the best odds if the user is intending to place a bet. Saves the hassle of going through each sport betting platform to see what the offers are on sport games/matches.
    <br>    <li>          Hand selected users will be made a “moderator” or “admin”. This will give them the role of banning and deleting hate speech and nasty comments, banning users, updating live odds to keep the platform efficient.
    <br>     <li>        The app will give a computer generated “safe bet” feature – this allows users to get an understanding on how much they should spend on a certain game or multi. This psychologically helps the user watch their spending whilst gambling.
    <br>       <li>    Users can become friends with one another, post on discussion boards, comment on posts and privately message another user.
    <br>             <li>The UI will be simple, modern and easy to navigate, as I want the application to be a tool for users to quickly use before placing an informed bet.
    <br>          <li>    The platform will contain an in-app game called “SportsBuzz Tips”. This is where all registered users on the app can tip against one another and hold their own tipping competitions on selected sports.
    <br>       <li>       Users must be 18 years of age or older to sign up and access all of the platform’s features. This can be done by submitting a form of ID during the registration process
    <br>       <li>       Users under the age of 18 cannot access all content in the SportsBuzz app, however they can play the in-app game of “SportsBuzz” tips with other users.
    <br>      <li>       The app/website will only be available within Australia. Therefore, making the users gain a sense of security and reliability when using the app and taking in the information provided.
    <br>       <li>       The app/website will be free to use for all users with no hidden fees. Only listed within the Australian market (Australian App Store)

        <b>  Tools and Technologies</b>
          <b>Software:</b>
    <br>      -          Google trends (This is the ‘market-research’ phase of the development. This tool allows the developer to analyse the demands and constraints surrounding the app genre/topic)
    <br>      -          Online mock- up websites (Any mock-up/design website will be applicable, gives the developer a deeper insight on what the interface will look like for the user).
    <br>      -          Origami Studio (a tool for designing modern user interfaces)
    <br>      -          HTML/CSS required (needed for the websites development)
    <br><br>    <b>  Hardware:</b>
    <br>      -          Hand drawn mock-ups
    <br>      -          Printers
    <br>      -          Speakers
    <br>      -          USB/HDD

    <br><br>     <b> Other Equipment:</b>
    <br>      -          Stationary (Pens, Pencils, etc)
    <br><br>      <b>Skills Required:</b>
    <br>      -          Basic HTML/CSS coding skills will be required for the website’s development
    <br>      -          Open-mindedness and creativity is a must!
    <br>      -          Quick problem-solving skills
    <br>      -          Basic computer knowledge (files, chrome, word, etc)
    <br>      -          As the app/website is sports based, a strong background knowledge in sports would be an additional bonus.
          Finding the skills with the software and hardware would not be too hard as basic HTML/CSS knowledge is easy to pick up on and will be required for the project.

        <h3>  Outcome </h3>
          If the project is successful, the outcome will be a fully functional app/website that will be free to download for all Australians. The program will allow users to view live odds of competing sport betting platforms, access to a large range of discussions/forums and other tools to help users make an informed decision before placing a bet.
          The original problem of Australian punters losing their money will decrease as they have the access to live discussions and opinions of upcoming sporting events, gaining a deeper understanding of what the outcome may be, thereby decreasing their chances of losing.
          Without this new development, Australian punters are unaware of what their winning chances are when placing a bet. Therefore, providing a free service will positively impact all punters by giving all users a deep insight into what the odds may be and gaining information from other punters who may be more knowledgeable in certain sports. It is a collaborative tool. The more people involved, the better the outcome
