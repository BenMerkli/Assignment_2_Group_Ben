        <br><b>Background/Hobbies & IT Experience/Interests: </b>
                    <br>I was born here in Melbourne, Australia and
                    <br>grew up in the south-east suburb, Mulgrave, which is located
                    <br>between Springvale and Glen Waverley.
                    <br>I am half Lebanese and half Hungarian; however, I can only
                    <br>speak English fluently based on my upbringing. I attended
                    <br>Glen Waverley South Primary School (2008-2014) and then
                    <br>transitioned to Brentwood Secondary College to complete
                    <br>high school and obtain VCE certificate (2015-2020).
                    <br>
                    <br>I have played Australian Football my entire life, as
                    <br>it is something I really enjoy and quite decent at.
                    <br>One fun fact about me is that I have been invited to a
                    <br>player development course/session with the Oakleigh Chargers
                    <br>and Hawthorn Football clubto improve on my skills and football
                    <br>knowledge, therefore this can become a gateway to the AFL.
                    <br>
                    <br>My interest in IT ranges to a variety of aspects within the
                    <br>term “IT”. I am veryfond of cybersecurity and its ability
                    <br>to protect systems from harmful risks and gain access into
                    <br>areas an average individual would not be able to do.
                    <br>Moreover, I am very interested in the software and hardware
                    <br>that is in a computer and how certain bits and pieces of wires
                    <br>and plastic can create one of the world's most innovative creations.
                    <br>
                    <br>When I was in Year 6 at Glen Waverley South Primary School,
                    <br>I was elected as an ICT captain for the school, which heavily
                    <br>involved being surrounded by computers, interactive whiteboards,
                    <br>and other IT related items. My role was to solve computer related
                    <br>issues students and teachers would endure and solve these issues
                    <br>with the school’s IT department. The role also carried across onto
                    <br>setting up the computers, microphones, and presentation requirements
                    <br>for the school’s weekly assemblies.<br>

                      <br><b>Background/Hobbies & IT Experience/Interests:</b>
                      <br>I was born and raised in Bendigo which is a country town 2 hours drive from melbourne.
                      My hobbies are mostly just playing video games and going out with mates to pubs and parties and such.
                      <br><br>My interest in IT has mostly been a lifelong thing, my dad works in telecommunications so I was always surrendered by computers, tech, and especially phones, I also realised and expanded this interest in school when I took a number of IT related electives.
                      <br>I have been programming for about 6 years now and I have a fair bit of practical experience with networks and working with phones and the internet because of my dad’s job.


                      <br><b><br>What do these test results mean and how can they be helpful to your group?</b>
                      <br>The results from these tests highlight that I have the personality traits of being a ‘natural-born leader’. People with this personality type embody the gifts of charisma and confidence,
                      sand project authority in a way that draws crowds together behind a common goal. <br><br>After having taken the educationplanner.org Learning Style test with my results coming back as Auditory:
                      35%, Visual: 30%, and Tactile: 35% in terms of learning preferences with resulting <br>learning type being Auditory/Tactile. <br><br>This corresponds to
                      group meetings as I will be able to fully<br> comprehend what each person is saying and understand their <br> deliverance on a deeper level. After having taken the MindTools<br> creativity my results returned
                      as a 56 out of 80, this <br>being in the high part of the middle creativity range of 37-58.

        Joshua Lam <i>(s3902169)</i></center>
        <br><b>Background/Hobbies & IT Experience/Interests:</b>
        <br>My name is Joshua Lam, and I was born and raised in Australia.
        <br>My ethnicity is half vietnamese and half timorese. I have completed
        VCE Year 12 and graduated with a 72.3 ATAR, which has led me to
        currently study a Bachelors of IT at RMIT. My main spoken language
        is English.
      <br>
        <br>I have loved to play video games ever since I was young,
        <br>and have also recently gained an interest in cars as well. I’ve
        <br>recently purchased a vehicle, a Toyota 86, and have added various
        <br>mods/self-serviced it.
        <br>
        <br>My interest in IT involves enjoying taking
        sthe time to accurately locate and fix problems, and developed since
        I was a young age as I grew up with computers. My IT experience
        revolves mostly around self-learnt abilities such as CMD prompt,
        Device Manager, and being able to make HTML websites. I have also
        bbuilt many computers, including my own and friends.
        <br>
        <br><b>What do these test results mean to you and how can they help your group?</b>
        <br>I find these test results very interesting, as they provide meaningful,
        honest results to reveal what type of personality one has. Being a
        supposed ‘commander’ personality, it depicts that I should show
        leadership within my team, however if there is another ‘commander’
        I am happy to easily follow another <br>person's instructions.
        These personality tests can be used as a basis to
        <br>outline what type of
        learner and person each of your team members <br>are, and further your
        understanding and synergy with them which I<br> believe help to increase
        team productivity.

            <br><b>Background/Hobbies & IT Experience/Interests:</b>
                <br>My parents both come from Vietnam and they both speak Vietnamese and Cantonese, as do I however I am not very fluent in any of those languages.
                I have just recently graduated high school and I am currently studying my first year of Bachelor of IT at RMIT University. During my spare time,
                I enjoy playing games with my friends. <br><br>Ever since I was young I had always had an interest in IT. It was something that I grew up around.
                My cousins were the ones who inspired and introduced me to computers and IT in general. Where I used to watch my cousins play games on their computers
                 and watch them build and work on their websites. 2017 was the year where my knowledge of IT and computers grew most and was also the year that I decided
                 that I wanted to pursue a career in IT.
                   <br><br>Before starting UNI I had a little bit of experience in HTML from high school where I had taken an Introduction to Computing class, besides that, I didn’t have any experience.
                    However, since I started UNI I recently started to learn Python and as well as learn more HTML.
                Personal Profile
                <br><br><b>What do these test results mean to you and how can they help your group?</b>
                <br>In terms of how these results may reflect in the team, I believe<br> that there are pros and cons, pros being that it may help the team<br> to be more productive if there are individuals who are independent<br> as
                they can take the initiative in completing the set tasks. However, <br>the cons being, individuals who rely mostly on their skills may lack<br> in communicating with their team members which may be <br>counterproductive instead.

      <center><b>Personal Information:</b><br>
      Anton Catalano <i>(s3890351)</i></center>
      <br><b>Background/Hobbies & IT Experience/Interests:</b>
<br>
        Born and raised in Melbourne, Australia.  I have an Italian background, where grandparents from both sides immigrated from Italy.  I completed VCE in 2018. I did study for an undergraduate degree in Speech Pathology at ACU for two years.
        I withdrew at the end of 2020 to pursue something that I am more interested and passionate about, which is IT. Speak fluent English and I’m a passionate follower of sport, especially AFL and EPL. <br><br>My main interest in IT is the fact that I am engaging with technology daily. Whether it's from a television set to a laptop, I utilise it everyday. What's been a constant reminder of gaining interest in IT is of me solving errors that I come across when using a laptop.  Currently, I have great knowledge in knowing how to use a computer. Having utilised a computer for over 10 years now, I can understand the specific basics on how to use it. <br><br>I'm also a keen learner and am willing to add some key skills to my arsenal. Whether it's from my casual job to currently in my first year, I'm really invested in learning new things and gaining such valuable insight.
        Formation of teams is always quite the challenging situation. <br><br>Everyone is unique in their own personality and how they act in teams may counteract how they act in different environments. Therefore when taking into account the results collated in the three respective tests, it would be vital to format teams with people that exhibit and relate with 1-2 conditions in those tests. <br><br>Building rapport would be all the more necessary in these environments, yet, <br>understanding how an individual acts in those few solitary moments would be<br> important in knowing how you can relate with them. Showing those few qualities <br>that you can associate with your fellow team members would ultimately help make <br>completing the task more successful but more enjoyable as well.
